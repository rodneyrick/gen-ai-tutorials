## Domain Complexity
- Domain Description: The Complexity domain in source code metrics refers to the complexity of the code, primarily measured by cyclomatic complexity. Cyclomatic complexity is a quantitative metric that calculates the number of paths through the code. Each time the control flow of a function branches, the complexity counter is incremented by one. Each function has a minimum complexity of 1. This metric may vary slightly depending on the programming language due to language-specific keywords and features. Additionally, cognitive complexity is an additional measure that assesses how difficult it is to understand the control flow of the code. This metric provides insight into the mental complexity involved in understanding the code beyond simple path counting
