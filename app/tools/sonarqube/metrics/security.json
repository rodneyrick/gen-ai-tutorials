    "Context": "The Security domain in source code metrics deals with the identification and management of security vulnerabilities and threats. It includes measures such as the total number of vulnerabilities, both in existing code and in new code, as well as security classification based on the severity of the vulnerabilities found. The security remediation effort metric indicates the time required to fix all identified vulnerabilities. Additionally, the number of critical security points and their review are monitored to ensure the effectiveness of implemented security measures. These metrics are essential to ensure the integrity and robustness of the software against potential threats",
