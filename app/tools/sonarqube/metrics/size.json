    "Context": "The Size domain in source code metrics encompasses various measures related to the size and structure of the code. This includes counting classes, lines of code, directories, and files, as well as the density of comment lines in relation to the code. Additionally, metrics such as the number of functions and statements provide insights into the complexity and granularity of the code. These measures are crucial for evaluating the scalability, maintainability, and readability of the software, assisting in the development process and ensuring code quality over time",
