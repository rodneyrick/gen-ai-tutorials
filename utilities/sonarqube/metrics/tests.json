    "Context": "The Tests domain in source code metrics focuses on evaluating the coverage and effectiveness of unit tests. This includes metrics such as condition coverage, line coverage, and metrics related to the execution of unit tests. Condition coverage analyzes whether each boolean expression in lines of code was evaluated as both true and false during test execution. Line coverage indicates whether each line of code was executed during the tests. Additional metrics include the total number of unit tests, test execution duration, number of errors and failures in tests, and the test success density, which calculates the percentage of successful tests relative to the total tests. These metrics are crucial to ensure the quality and reliability of the software, providing insights into the effectiveness of the implemented tests",
